<p><font face="Arial" size="4">This was our first redesign. I didn't like it and 
changed it 4 days later. Unfortunately it's the first backup on the Wayback 
Machine so if someone were to look there they would see this. Anyways, it 
changed the WordArt and moved it to the corner. It also moved the Flag Counter 
to the top right. We pushed this out despite not liking it because people 
complained about the background being hard on the eyes and the site looking too 
similar to 2003page. We decided to leave the tiled background behind and enter 
the world of solid colors. After 4 days I decided &quot;Screw it&quot; and went back to 
the design I liked.</font></p>
