<p><font size="4">This update is a big one. There is now WordArt (WordArt is 
text that is stored as an image and has custom fonts that are impossible with 
normal text) and it has more buttons. Floobby's site is now done and has a 
button on the main site. 2003downloads has also been updated to feature more
