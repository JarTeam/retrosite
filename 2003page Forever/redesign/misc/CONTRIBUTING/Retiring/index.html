<p>If you're tried on managing your 2003page subsite. Here's how to retire it.</p>
<p>Retiring a sub-subsite/subpage just requires deleting the folder/file and 
remove any references to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1. Add a message on your index that explains on why you're moving on 
from 2003page. It should include the date that the entire subsite (i mean 
everything in it) will be wiped out.</p>
<p>Step 2. Once the date reaches and you wiped your subsite out. Copy
<a href="TEMPLATE.html">TEMPLATE.html</a> to your subsite and change the name to 
Index.html</p>
<p><font face="Arial"><strike>Step 3. Request to <a href="mailto:support@cloudsoftware.cf">
support@cloudsoftware.cf</a> that you want to no longer be a outside collabrator 
of Rappa Sites.</strike> (operations of the email address has been discontinued 
per 2003tech restructurement)</font></p>
<p>Step 4. After roughly 2 weeks, another 2003page collabrator will delete 
your subsite.</p>
