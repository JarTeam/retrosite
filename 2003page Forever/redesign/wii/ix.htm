<h2 align="left"><i>Why does this exist?</i></h2>

<p align="left"><font size="4">After the redesign of March 2020 (Which 
introduced gradients and expanded the purple color scheme), ChazizPF94 has 
noticed that lag had begun to appear when using the Wii's Internet Channel, 
which uses a 2006/2007 version of Opera (Opera 9/10?).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">This varient of the main page was originally made 
for the Wii Shop Channel, which was discovered to be able to load other sites. 
However, the idea was later scrapped.</font></p>
