<p><font size="4">2003page is starting to get popular now. There are a lot more 
contributors, including (but not limited to) Chaziz and Endermite. There is also 
a sitemap now and a flag counter (it counts how many people visit the site and 
where they're from). There are also a lot more buttons and there is new WordArt 
at the top.</font></p>
