<p>Yes, you know that I've been looking at you for a long time</p>
<p>I must dance with you today (DY)</p>
<p>(<em>Daddy Yankee</em>)</p>
<p>I saw that the look in your eyes was calling me</p>
<p>Show me the path that I will take (Oh)</p>
<p>(<em>Luis Fonsi</em>)</p>
<p>You, you're the magnet and I'm the metal</p>
<p>I am getting closer and making a plan</p>
<p>Simply thinking about it makes my heart race (Oh yeah)</p>
<p>(<em>Daddy Yankee</em>)</p>
<p>Now, I'm already liking it more than usual</p>
<p>All of my senses are asking for more</p>
<p>We cannot do this in a rush</p>
<p>(<em>Luis Fonsi</em>)</p>
<p>Slowly</p>
<p>I want to breathe in your neck slowly</p>
<p>Let me murmur things in your ear</p>
<p>So that you remember if you're not with me</p>
<p>Slowly</p>
<p>I want to undress you in kisses slowly</p>
<p>Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth</p>
<p>And of your body, I want to create a manuscript</p>
<p>Up, up</p>
<p>Up, up, up</p>
<p>I want to see your hair dance</p>
<p>I want to be your rhythm</p>
<p>Want you to show my mouth</p>
<p>Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)</p>
<p>Let me trespass your danger zones</p>
<p>Until I make you scream</p>
<p>And you forget your last name</p>
<p>(<em>Daddy Yankee</em>)</p>
<p>If I ask for a kiss come give it to me</p>
<p>I know that you're thinking about it</p>
<p>I've been trying to do it for awhile</p>
<p>Mami this is giving and giving it to you</p>
<p>You know that with me your heart goes bom bom</p>
<p>You know that from me that babe is looking for a bom bom</p>
<p>Come try my mouth and see if you like its taste</p>
<p>I want to see how much love fits in you</p>
<p>I'm not in a rush I want to experience this trip</p>
<p>Let's start slowly, then savagely</p>
<p>Step by step, soft then softly</p>
<p>We come up against each other, little by little</p>
<p>When you kiss me in that state of distress</p>
<p>I see that you are malice and delicacy</p>
<p>Step by step, soft then softly</p>
<p>We come up against each other, little by little</p>
<p>And it's just that your beauty is a puzzle</p>
<p>But to finish it here I have the missing piece</p>
<p>(<em>Luis Fonsi</em>)</p>
<p>Slowly</p>
<p>I want to breathe in your neck slowly</p>
<p>Let me murmur things in your ear</p>
<p>So that you remember if you're not with me</p>
<p>Slowly</p>
<p>I want to undress you in kisses slowly</p>
<p>Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth</p>
<p>And of your body, I want to create a manuscript</p>
<p>Up, up, up, up</p>
<p>I want to see your hair dance</p>
<p>I want to be your rhythm</p>
<p>Want you to show my mouth</p>
<p>Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)</p>
<p>Let me trespass your danger zones</p>
<p>Until I make you scream</p>
<p>And you forget your last name</p>
<p>Slowly</p>
<p>We're gonna do it on a beach in Puerto Rico</p>
<p>Until the waves scream Oh Lord</p>
<p>So that my seal stays with you</p>
<p>(<em>Daddy Yankee</em>)</p>
<p>Step by step, soft then softly</p>
<p>We come up against each other, little by little</p>
<p>(<em>Luis Fonsi</em>)</p>
<p>I want you to show my mouth</p>
<p>Your favorite places (Favorite, favorite baby)</p>
<p>(<em>Daddy Yankee</em>)</p>
<p>Step by step, soft then softly</p>
<p>We come up against each other, little by little</p>
<p>(<em>Luis Fonsi</em>)</p>
<p>Until I make you scream</p>
<p>And you forget your last name</p>
<p>Slowly.</p>
