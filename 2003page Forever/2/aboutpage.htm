<p><font size="4">I can't help but say I'm disappointed. I know I'm a 2003page 
contributor now but I wasn't when this site came out so I don't have to suck up 
to it yet. Since I don't have to suck up to it yet I can give my honest opinion. This site was under 
construction for 2 days and it's just some text and a button. Speaking of that 
button it takes us to XPUser's finished site. His site looks really good 
compared to 2003page right now. I hope to see that change soon.</font></p>
