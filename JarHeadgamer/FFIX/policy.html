            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We use cookies for limited purposes. For example, we place a cookie on your computer when you register so that the next time you visit this Site, we can tell you are a user who has registered. This allows us to avoid presenting you additional registration forms. In addition, a cookie may be placed on your computer if you click on one of Square Enix USA's advertising banners on another Web site. Cookies used with advertising banners permits us to count the number of users who clicked on that ad and the site from which they clicked, so that we can measure the effectiveness of our advertisements.</font></p>

            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">You may adjust your Web browsers to either alert you of the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. For Internet Explorer or AOL users, you can click on the "Start" button and then select Control Panel, Internet Options and the Security tab.
