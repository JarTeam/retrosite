<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">As a VFD/VU meter nerd, my favorite WebTV 
excusive feature by far is the audioscope. Let me show you how to use it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">To start out, just pop the <i>&lt;audioscope&gt; </i>
tag in the body section of your code. You'll see a very simple audioscope that 
looks like this:</font></p>
<audioscope>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Of course, this isn't exactly the most pleasant thing to look at right now. Let's try changing the background 
color. Similar to many other HTML tags, we can do this by using the <i>&lt;bgcolor&gt;
</i>attribute. I'll change my audioscope color to black by changing my code to <i>&lt;audioscope 
bgcolor=#000000&gt;</i>.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">That looks much better, doesn't it? Of course, it 
also looks a bit thin, so i'll try stretching it out with the <i>&lt;width&gt; </i>
attribute. If you want your audioscope to go across the entire screen, I recommend 
setting the width to 861, so it looks correct on the Japan exclusive Sega 
Dreamcast version.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861">
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">That's much better, but let's say I want to 
change the height. This works the same way as the <i>&lt;width&gt; </i>attribute, but with
<i>&lt;height&gt;</i> this time. I'll set the height to 50.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50">
<p>You can also set a border around the audioscope with the <i>&lt;border&gt;</i> attribute. 
I'll add a border with a size of 4.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50" border="4">
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Now we're getting into audioscope exclusive 
territory. Say you want to lower the height of the right channel bar, to look 
more like the audioscope that appears in the title bar when you play an audio 
file. To do this, you can use the <i>&lt;rightoffset&gt; </i>attribute. I'll set it to 5. Of 
course, you can also change the offset of the left channel as well if you'd 
like. You can also use negative numbers to raise a channel.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50" border="4" rightoffset="5">
<p>If you'd like to change the color of the channels, you can use the <i>&lt;leftcolor&gt;
</i>or <i>&lt;rightcolor&gt; </i>attributes. I'll make both channels red.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50" border="4" rightoffset="5" leftcolor="red" rightcolor="red">
<p>If you want a bar that shows the maximum level of the audioscope over time, 
use the <i>&lt;maxlevel=&quot;true&quot;&gt; </i>attribute.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50" border="4" rightoffset="5" leftcolor="red" rightcolor="red" maxlevel="true">
<p>If you want the audioscope to act more dramatically, you can also set the gain of the audioscope with the <i>&lt;gain&gt; </i>attribute. I'll 
set the gain of my audioscope to 3.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50" border="4" rightoffset="5" leftcolor="red" rightcolor="red" maxlevel="true" gain="3">
<p>If you set the gain to 0, you'll get a different audioscope that looks like a 
level meter. Unfortunately, <i>&lt;maxlevel&gt; </i>doesn't seem to work here.</p>
<audioscope bgcolor=#000000 width="861" height="50" border="4" rightoffset="5" leftcolor="red" rightcolor="red" gain="0">
<p>And finally, if you put all of this together, you can create some very 
complicated and interesting audioscopes. Here's one I made a few months ago.</p>
<table bgcolor=#111111 border=4><td>
<audioscope height=50 width=861 rightoffset=5 rightcolor=#111111 bgcolor=#111111 border=5>
<audioscope height=20 width=861 rightoffset=5 bgcolor=#111111 gain=0 maxlevel border=5>
<audioscope height=50 width=861 leftoffset=5 leftcolor=#111111 bgcolor=#111111 border=5>
