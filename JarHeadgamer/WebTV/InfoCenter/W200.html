<p><font face="Arial" size="4">For some reason, Sony neglected to put an audio 
jack on the INT-W200. Here's how you can capture audio without it.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">I have no idea why Sony didn't add an audio jack. 
One quick look at the board tells you that the pads for the audio jack are 
there, but there isn't any jack there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Anyways, W200 owners still have a way to capture 
audio, and in some cases it may actually be easier than the standard audio jack. 
All you need to do is plug something into the RCA in on the back of your 
INT-W200 (Music Player, Camcorder, etc.) and record as you normally would. Of 
course it's much easier to record from most devices with the standard audio 
jack, but the solution for the INT-W200 is workable.</font></p>
