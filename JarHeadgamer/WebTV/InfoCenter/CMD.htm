<p><font face="Arial" size="4">If you've ever used a WebTV keyboard, you've 
probably noticed the CMD key. I'll show you what it does, and how you can use it 
to make your life easier.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">The CMD key is like the CTRL key on computers. 
You can use it to do normal things like copy and paste text in a text box, but 
you can also use it to do WebTV things.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">If you want to copy some text from a text box, 
you would use CMD+C. Similarly, you would use CMD+V to paste it. You can also 
use CMD+Left/Right arrow to jump to the beginning or end of a text box. You can 
use CMD+A to select everything, and you can use CMD+Delete to delete a line of 
text.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">But that's just for text editing, you can also 
use the CMD key for shortcuts to things in the options panel. You can use CMD+F 
to open the Find panel, CMD+Y to open the Messenger panel, and CMD+P to print. 
You can also use CMD+Power to hang up the phone, and you can use CMD+Options to 
show the advanced bar (if you box doesn't do that automatically). Next, you can 
use CMD+W to open the PIP window and CMD+M to move it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">In the Address Book panel, you can hit CMD+Any 
letter to jump to the first contact with that as the first letter in their name. 
You can use CMD+G to search for the next occurrence of a string after using the 
find panel, or you can use CMD+B to search for the previous occurrence. You can 
use CMD+R to reload a page and CMD+Scroll Up/Down to jump to the top or bottom 
of a page. Finally, you can use CMD+CTRL to see the URL of a link.</font></p>
