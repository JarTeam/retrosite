<p><font face="Arial" size="4">NTSC colors on a CRT can be very picky sometimes. 
Here's how I made my website more readable, and how you can do it too</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">CRTs are <i>not </i>the same as computer 
monitors. Something that may look fine on the oldest of PC monitors may look 
terrible on a CRT. If you want to make your site readable on a CRT, the first 
thing to do is make sure it isn't <i>already </i>readable on a CRT. If you don't 
have a CRT or WebTV box, get one of your friends to test it on their CRT. If you 
conclude that your website is too hard to read on a CRT, there's two things I 
would do. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">First, I would try making the text bold. After 
that, I would use the

Color Picker</a>. All you do is put in your background color, and it will give 
you a different color that looks better on a CRT. After using these tips, your 
site should be readable on pretty much any TV.</font></p>
