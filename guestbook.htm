<p><font face="Arial" size="5">Aight, here the story</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5">Our guestbook provider (smartgb.com) has decided 
to terminate our guestbook to try and get us to spend money on their crappy 
&quot;premium&quot; service. This is the note they put up:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="verdana,tahoma,arial"><b>This Guestbook is temporarily 
disabled</b></p>
<p>Since this guestbook has been embedded or inserted using an iframe without 
our permission we have unfortunately been forced to temporarily disable the 
guestbook.</p>
<p>The guestbook admin can
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.smartgb.com/premium.php?id=g36-31793-df&p=show-iframe2">
re-activate it by upgrading to a premium account</a>. The guestbook will then be 
automatically re-activated within 3-5 minutes.</p>
<p>Administrators are welcome to
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.smartgb.com/contact_form.php?type=support&id=g36-31793-df">
contact us</a> if they have any questions about this guestbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.smartgb.com/?p=iframeinactive">Create a new 
free guestbook</a></font><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="5">So not only did they hold our guestbook for 
ransom, they ALSO tried to lure more people into their hellhole of a service. If 
you have any guestbooks that are running on smartgb.com I urge you to try and 
find a better service as soon as you can.</font></p>
